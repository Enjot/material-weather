     Double themes.xml allows to set up correct status bar icon colors
     right off the bat, otherwise on light theme, during splash screen
     (with white background) icons are dark, then switch to light ones
     and then switch to dark ones again. Delay is visible and distracting.
     I tried to set up it in onCreate function of MainActivity but delay
     still existed. Second themes.xml for dark theme allows system
     to set correct colors before activity starts. Then composable
     code from accompanist library has control over system bars and
     change everything when system theme changes.
